This might sound familiar to a lot of people:\n\nWhat should I write about?\nWill anyone read my article?\nHow do I make my article stand out?\nShould I even write?\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever asked yourself these questions, you\u2019ll find the answers in this free crash course on how to write impactful and awesome data science articles!\n",

It is one of the most important concepts in a data scientist\u2019s daily role - and yet most newcomers and beginners haven\u2019t even come across it! This is a fallacy you must overcome as soon as possible.\nYou need to understand how to navigate through Git and GitHub if you want to make it as a data science professional. While a lot of folks know about these tools (having used them for cloning open source code from Google Research and other top data science organizations), they never really understand their real purpose.\nThe beauty of version control will be akin to a revelation. The way you can create a remote project and have all your team members work on different features parallelly yet independently but still have a stable running code at the end of the day - priceless! A lot of the problem we face in data science while working remotely and independently will be erased with a quick understanding of Git and GitHub.\nYes, this course really is that important!\n",

        "text": "\nWhat is Sentiment Analysis?\n\nSentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a technique used to analyse the emotion in a text. We can extract the attitude or the opinion of a piece of text and get insights on it.\u00a0\nIn the context of machine learning, you can think of Sentiment Analysis as a Classification problem where the text can either have a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment or a neutral one.\n\n\nWhat are the applications of Sentiment Analysis in the industry?\n\nIn the age of social media, it is extremely common to comment about\u00a0\na movie you liked or\u00a0\na book you didn\u2019t like or\u00a0\na product you bought was not up to the mark.\n\n\nTherefore, a lot of companies use sentiment analysis for their products since it provides direct feedback of the customer\u2019s opinion.\nIt is also important to detect and remove hateful content from social media and companies like Twitter, Facebook, etc. extensively use sentiment analysis on a daily basis.\n\n\u00a0\nOn what kind of projects would I implement sentiment analysis?\nThere are a wide variety of projects where you can use Sentiment Analysis. Here are a couple of popular use cases:\n\nSentiment Analysis can not only be used for customer reviews or product feedback, but in other domains as well.\nAnalyzing the sentiments on social media on the US Elections, for example, gives useful insights on which candidates are favoured by the public and which are not.\n\nFor other interesting problems involving sentiment/emotion detection, you can visit: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/\n\nWhat is the range of sentiments that can be observed and analysed?\n\nIn the earlier days of\u00a0Natural language processing\u00a0and Sentiment Analysis, the sentiments could hold only 2 or 3 values: Positive or Negative, and Positive, Neutral or Negative.\nHowever, with the advent of deep learning, we can now recognize the subtle emotions in a text as well.\nThis has made tasks like Sarcasm detection, fake news detection etc. popular in research areas of Natural language processing\u00a0\n\n\nCan I add this project to my resume and use it in my Interview?\n\nSentiment Analysis is one of the most popular applications of Machine Learning and Classification in Natural language processing\nWe also encourage you to take up more diverse datasets and apply sentiment analysis on them.\nSentiment Analysis is also one of the first projects you would learn in your Natural language processing journey and as such is commonly asked in interviews.\n\n",

It\u2019s a really powerful way to deal with huge datasets, as you\u2019ll see in this course!\nEvery data scientist, aspiring established, should be aware of the different dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, t-SNE, High Correlation Filter, Missing Value Ratio, among others.\nSo in this beginner-friendly course, you will learn the basics of dimensionality reduction and why you should know dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We will also cover 12 dimensionality reduction techniques! This course is as comprehensive an introduction as you can get!\n\n",

It has the support of the likes of Google, Apple, and FastAI behind it!\n\u201cI always hope that when I start looking at a new language, there will be some mind-opening new ideas to find, and Swift definitely doesn\u2019t disappoint. Swift tries to be expressive, flexible, concise, safe, easy to use, and fast. Most languages compromise significantly in at least one of these areas.\u201d \u2013 Jeremy Howard\nAnd when Jeremy Howard endorses a language and starts using it for his daily data science work, you need to drop everything and listen.\nIn this free course on Swift for Data Science, we will learn about Swift as a programming language and how it fits into the data science space.

        "text": "\nThe need and importance of extracting data from the web is becoming increasingly loud and clear. There is an unprecedented volume of data on the internet right now - and data science projects often need this data to build predictive models.\nThat\u2019s a key reason why data scientists are expected to be familiar with web scraping.\nWe have found web scraping to be a very helpful technique for gathering data from multiple websites. Some websites these days also provide APIs for many different types of data you might want to use, such as Tweets or LinkedIn posts.\nBut there might be occasions when you need to collect data from a website that does not provide a specific API. This is where having the ability to perform web scraping comes in handy. As a data scientist, you can code a simple Python script and extract the data you\u2019re looking for.\nSo knowing how to perform web scraping using Python will help you go a long way towards becoming a resourceful data scientist. Are you ready to take the next step and dive in?\nA note of caution here \u2013 web scraping is subject to a lot of guidelines and rules. Not every website allows the user to scrape content so there are certain legal restrictions at play. Always ensure you read the website\u2019s terms and conditions on web scraping before you attempt to do it.\nIn this course, we will dive into the basics of web scraping using Python. We will understand what web scraping is, the different Python libraries for performing web scraping, and finally we\u2019ll implement web scraping using Python in a real-world project. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here so enroll today and start learning!\n",

The critical question, then, is whether our idea is significantly better than what we tried previously.\nThese ideas that we come up with on such a regular basis \u2013 that\u2019s essentially what a hypothesis is.
